## What is this gamemode about?

SCP: Secret Fortress is a Team Fortress 2 gamemode, developed by Batfoxkid, aimed at recreating the `SCP: Secret Laboratory` gameplay experience. It features (most of) the content, logic and strategy from SCP:SL with some slight modifications due to how TF2 works, but it's great nonetheless!

## Why does this gamemode exist if we have SCP:SL?

Not everyone has a PC able to run SCP:SL, plus it's a very unoptimized game. So what's better than having the Secret Laboratory experience (and more!) in TF2? And as per Batfoxkid, why not?
