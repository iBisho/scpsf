# RED Team

## Class-D

> Class-D ("Disposable Class") personnel are expendable individuals used for testing SCPs, notably Keter-class objects. They are unwillingly recruited by the SCP Foundation worldwide and are usually death row inmates. In times of duress, the Foundation will recruit individuals from civilian sources or inmates incarcerated of lesser crimes. Civilians can also 'sign up' to be part of the Class-D program at the Foundation.

As a Class-D personnel, your mission is to escape from the facility by any means possible, avoiding contact with Guards, MTFs and SCPs. You're the VIP of the RED Team, survival is your team's priority to achieve success. Chaos Insurgents will spawn to help you out.

You spawn as a Scout in Light Containment Zone with no keycard.

## Chaos Insurgent

> The Chaos Insurgency are a splinter group, antagonistic to the SCP Foundation. This faction is mainly built on scientists and guards of the oundation that, in 1924, went A.W.O.L. (Absent Without Official Leave) with several SCPs that could be vital sources of information to the Foundation. The Insurgency also wants to take down the SCP Foundation by possibly unleashing several Euclid and Keter-class SCPs.

As a Chaos Insurgent, your mission is to rescue Class-D Personnel and neutralise any threats (such as MTFs, Guards or SCPs) to them. If you have a disarmer, you can use it on a Scientist to (when they escape) convert into a Chaos Insurgent instead of MTF Personnel. You can remain neutral to SCPs if they don't pose a threat to Class-Ds.

You spawn in waves throughout the round as a Pyro (with custom model) on the surface near Gate A with a Logicer, a Chaos Insurgency Access Device and a Medkit.

# BLU Team

## Scientist

> Scientists, also referred to as Doctors, form the backbone of the Foundation; they work on a wide range of roles from standard research to more specialized fields. They are SCP Foundation Personnel who research and study SCP artifacts.

As a Scientist, your mission is to escape from the facility by any means possible, avoiding contact with Class-Ds, Chaos Insurgents and SCPs. You're the VIP of the BLU Team, survival is your team's priority to achieve success. Mobile Task Force Units will spawn to help you out.

You spawn as a Medic in Heavy Containment Zone with a Scientist Keycard and a Medkit.

## Facility Guard

> Guards are defensive personnel within the SCP Foundation. They are used to maintain the control in the site as well as to guard SCPs and Class-D personnel. The guards act as defense against possible containment breaches, and to ensure that Class-D personnel comply with orders and do not attempt to escape.

As a Facility Guard, your mission is to protect Scientists, disarm or neutralise armed Class-D personnel and terminate SCP subjects.

You spawn as a Sniper in Heavy Containment Zone with a MP7, a Facility Guard Keycard and a Radio.

## MTF Unit "Epsilon-11" - Nine Tailed Fox

> Mobile Task Forces are groups of specially-armed forces dedicated to the SCP Foundation, with each Task Force group performing specific functions. The amount of units in an individual squad can range from 3 to over 20. Each Task Force is assigned a unique combination of a Greek letter and a number. Nine-Tailed Fox is an intensively trained Task Force specializing in the protection and recontainment of SCP items.

As a MTF Personnel, your mission is to rescue Scientists, disarm or neutralise armed Class-D personnel and terminate SCP subjects. If you have a disarmer, you can use it on a Class-D to (when they escape) convert them into a MTF Cadet instead of Chaos Insurgency Agent.

MTF Units have 3 ranks:

### MTF Cadet

As a MTF Cadet, you can give orders to Facility Personnel. You spawn with a P90, a Flash Grenade, a MTF Cadet Keycard and a Radio.

### MTF Lieutenant

As a MTF Lieutenant, you can give orders to MTF Cadets and Facility Personnel. You spawn with an Epsilon-11 SR, a Fragmentation Grenade, a Pain Killer, a MTF Lieutenant Keycard, a Disarmer and a Radio.

### MTF Scientist

As a MTF Scientist, you can give orders to MTF Lieutenants, MTF Cadets and Facility Personnel. You spawn with an Epsilon-11 SR, a Fragmentation Grenade, a Medkit, a MTF Lieutenant Keycard, a Disarmer and a Radio.

> Note: MTF Scientist(s) spawn when Scientist(s) escape while not disarmed.

### MTF Commander

As a MTF Commander, you can give orders to all MTF Units and Facility Personnel. You spawn with an Epsilon-11 MR, a Fragmentation Grenade, a Pain Killer, a MTF Commander Keycard, a Disarmer and a Radio.

All of the MTF Personnel spawn in waves throughout the round on the surface near Gate B.
