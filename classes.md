# RED Team

## Class-D

> Class-D ("Disposable Class") personnel are expendable individuals used for testing SCPs, notably Keter-class objects. They are unwillingly recruited by the SCP Foundation worldwide and are usually death row inmates. In times of duress, the Foundation will recruit individuals from civilian sources or inmates incarcerated of lesser crimes. Civilians can also 'sign up' to be part of the Class-D program at the Foundation.

As a Class-D personnel, your mission is to escape from the facility by any means possible, avoiding contact with Guards, MTFs and SCPs. You're the VIP of the RED Team, survival is your team's priority to achieve success. Chaos Insurgents will spawn to help you out.

You spawn as a Scout in Light Containment Zone with no keycard.

## Chaos Insurgent

> The Chaos Insurgency are a splinter group, antagonistic to the SCP Foundation. This faction is mainly built on scientists and guards of the oundation that, in 1924, went A.W.O.L. (Absent Without Official Leave) with several SCPs that could be vital sources of information to the Foundation. The Insurgency also wants to take down the SCP Foundation by possibly unleashing several Euclid and Keter-class SCPs.

As a Chaos Insurgent, your mission is to help Class-D Personnel out of the facility and neutralise any threats (such as MTFs, Guards or SCPs) to them. If you have a disarmer, you can use it on a Scientist to (when they escape) convert them to Chaos Insurgents instead of MTFs. You can remain neutral to SCPs if they don't pose a threat to Class-Ds.

You spawn in waves as a Pyro (with custom model) on the surface with a Logicer, a Chaos Insurgency Access Device and a Medkit.

# BLU Team

## Scientist

> Scientists, also referred to as Doctors, form the backbone of the Foundation; they work on a wide range of roles from standard research to more specialized fields. They are SCP Foundation Personnel who research and study SCP artifacts.

As a Scientist, your mission is to escape from the facility by any means possible, avoiding contact with Class-Ds, Chaos Insurgents and SCPs. You're the VIP of the BLU Team, survival is your team's priority to achieve success. Mobile Task Force Units will spawn to help you out.

You spawn as a Medic in Heavy Containment Zone with a Scientist Keycard and a Medkit.

## Facility Guard

> Guards are defensive personnel within the SCP Foundation. They are used to maintain the control in the site as well as to guard SCPs and Class-D personnel. The guards act as defense against possible containment breaches, and to ensure that Class-D personnel comply with orders and do not attempt to escape.

As a Facility Guard, your mission is to protect Scientists, disarm or neutralise armed Class-D personnel and terminate SCPs.

You spawn as a Sniper in Heavy Containment Zone with a MP7, a Facility Guard Keycard and a Radio.
